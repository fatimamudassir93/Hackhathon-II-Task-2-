- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 4 user stories are independently testable and prioritized
- Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults for unspecified details
- 15 functional requirements cover all user-specified components and outcomes
- 8 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- 5 edge cases identified covering startup, failure, and resource scenarios
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers — all requirements have clear defaults
  based on user input and constitution mandates
